# Biomodals Workflow Development

Use this guide when creating or changing files under
`src/biomodals/workflow/` or shared workflow contracts under
`src/biomodals/schema/`.

## Vocabulary

- **App**: a deployed Modal app that owns tool runtime and app functions.
- **App Function**: a callable remote Modal function exposed by an app.
- **Local Entrypoint**: a CLI-only `@app.local_entrypoint`.
- **Workflow-Compatible App Function**: a remote app function returning
  `AppRunResult`.
- **Workflow Node**: one semantic DAG vertex.
- **App-Backed Node**: a workflow node that calls app functions.
- **Workflow-Native Node**: a workflow node implemented in workflow code.
- **Workflow Runtime**: validates and schedules workflow nodes.
- **Workflow Orchestrator**: the remote Modal function hosting the runtime.
- **Workflow Artifact**: durable data passed between workflow nodes.
- **Artifact Selector**: a named reference to upstream artifacts.
- **Worker Pool**: fixed-size remote workers for one node's fan-out tasks.

Avoid the terms `app node`, `runner node`, `engine`, and `workflow
entrypoint`; they are ambiguous in this codebase.

## Schema Boundaries

Shared contracts live in `biomodals.schema`.

Schema modules must not import `modal`, `biomodals.app`, or
`biomodals.workflow`. They should contain Pydantic models and primitive fields
only. App-specific config models stay with the app until they become stable
cross-module contracts.

Workflow-compatible app functions return `AppRunResult`. The workflow runtime
materializes each `AppOutput` into one or more `WorkflowArtifact` manifests.
Inline byte outputs must be written into the workflow run volume before they
cross a node boundary.

`AppRunResult.logs` are durable workflow artifacts too. The runtime writes log
outputs under `nodes/<node-id>/attempts/<attempt-id>/logs/` and records
artifact manifests for them so failed or partial attempts retain diagnostic
state.

Volume path outputs may either be referenced in place or copied into the
workflow run volume when the source volume is mounted locally. Reference mode is
the default because many app outputs are already durable in their owning app
volume. Copy mode is for workflows that need a self-contained run directory.

The first workflow runtime is Python-first. Pass a `Workflow` object across the
orchestrator boundary; serialized workflow dictionaries are intentionally
deferred until the node and app-function contracts stabilize.

## Node Execution Policy

Every workflow node checks durable run state before execution and skips work
when completed artifact manifests already exist.

Incomplete nodes use one of two policies:

- `RERUN`: discard incomplete attempt state and recompute.
- `RESUME`: use a durable node cache to resume or skip completed subwork.

Long-running nodes must be idempotent against deterministic run, node, input,
and attempt identifiers. Store resumable state in volumes, not container-local
scratch paths.

`AppRunStatus.PARTIAL` is terminal but not successful in the first runtime. The
runtime records the node as failed, records the run as failed, preserves logs,
and does not unblock downstream nodes.

Forced workflow runs replace the existing run directory before creating a fresh
ledger. Use force only when discarding previous artifacts, node caches, and
attempt records is intentional.

## Node Placement

Use `ORCHESTRATOR` placement for lightweight workflow-native logic such as
filtering, ranking, reporting, and small manifest transforms.

Use `REMOTE` placement for long-running work, app-backed work, and work that
benefits from failure isolation.

The runtime routes `REMOTE` nodes through an injected remote-node runner when
one is available. The Modal orchestrator supplies a thin remote runner that
executes one node in a separate Modal function and commits workflow volume
writes after node code returns. Unit tests use fake runners and must not call
live Modal APIs.

## Ledger Layout

The first durable run layout is:

```text
<workflow-volume>/<workflow-name>/<run-id>/
  run.json
  inputs/
  nodes/
    <node-id>/
      status.json
      attempts/
        <attempt-id>/
          started.json
          app_result.json
          logs/
          raw_outputs/
          materialized_outputs/
      cache/
  artifacts/
    <artifact-id>.json
  final/
```

Write JSON through ledger helpers so state files are replaced atomically where
practical. After volume writes inside Modal containers, call `commit()`. Before
reading data written by another container, call `reload()`.

`run.json` records the workflow name, run id, status, DAG hash, creation time,
and update time. Resuming a run with a different DAG hash fails unless the run
is forced, because stale node state cannot safely be reused across workflow
definition changes.

## Modal Preemption

All Modal functions are subject to preemption. Treat remote functions as
restartable with the same inputs.

Remote workflow code should:

- split long work into smaller retryable tasks;
- record attempt status before and after work;
- write cache checkpoints for `RESUME` nodes;
- use deterministic output paths from run and node identifiers;
- leave enough artifacts and logs to reconcile after restart.

## Fan-Out And Worker Pools

The first workflow runtime supports static DAGs with dynamic task fan-out.
The DAG shape is fixed, but a node may derive a runtime task list from upstream
artifacts.

Use barriered fan-out first: a node starts only after all declared upstream
dependencies are complete. Streaming between nodes is deferred.

A fan-out node may spawn a fixed-size worker pool. Workers process that node's
task queue until empty, then the node writes a single completion status.

Independent ready nodes may run in parallel when all dependencies for each node
are satisfied.

Keep worker-pool naming, task ids, queue enqueueing, and result aggregation in
pure helpers. Keep Modal queue creation, worker spawning, and
`FunctionCall.gather` calls in thin integration helpers so unit tests can use
fake queues and fake function calls.

## Orchestrator Submission

The reusable workflow orchestrator lives under `biomodals.workflow.core` and is
not a user-facing workflow script. Its local helper accepts a no-argument Python
factory in `module:function` form and submits the returned `Workflow` object to
the remote orchestrator. Domain-specific input staging belongs in top-level
workflow scripts such as `ppiflow_workflow.py`.

## PPIFlow V2 Status

`src/biomodals/workflow/ppiflow_v2.py` is currently a definition-only DAG
scaffold. It accepts upstream-style `task.yaml`, `steps.yaml`, and `stage`
inputs, then models the intended node graph and legacy output layout. It is not
an executable replacement for `ppiflow_workflow.py` until each app-backed node
is wired to a workflow-compatible app function and native filter/report nodes
implement result processing.

No safe live PPIFlow smoke fixture is committed yet. Current tests use tiny
synthetic `task.yaml` and `steps.yaml` payloads to validate stage selection,
dependencies, and the expected legacy output layout without executing Modal.

## App Interfaces

Local entrypoints stay CLI-only. They parse local paths, submit remote work,
download or report outputs, print user messages, and return `None`.

Workflow reuse happens through workflow-compatible remote app functions. These
functions may reuse behavior from local entrypoints or existing remote
functions, but they return `AppRunResult` and avoid local filesystem UX.

App-backed workflow nodes either define `app_name` and `function_name` so the
runtime can lazily import `modal.Function.from_name(...)`, or override
`load_app_function()`. They should override `build_app_function_kwargs()` to
translate `NodeRunContext.inputs` into the app function's primitive or Pydantic
arguments.

When adding a workflow-compatible app function, keep existing local entrypoint
behavior unchanged and add a focused pytest contract test that does not call
Modal live APIs.

## Testing

Keep tests under top-level `tests/`.

Use pytest for non-Modal tests. Tests must not call `.remote()`, `.spawn()`,
`modal.Function.from_name(...)`, real `modal.Queue`, real `modal.Volume`, or
deployed Modal apps. Mock Modal boundaries with fake objects and deterministic
`AppRunResult` or `WorkflowArtifact` payloads.
