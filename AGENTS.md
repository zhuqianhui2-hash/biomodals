# Biomodals Agent Instructions

## Repository expectations

- This is a Python 3.12+ project for running bioinformatics tools on Modal.
- Prefer `uv run ...` for project commands and `biomodals` CLI smoke tests. Never run `python ...` directly.
- Use `polars` for tabular data parsing and writing in Python code; avoid new
  `csv` or `pandas` parsing unless an upstream tool API specifically requires it.
- Use `orjson` for non-Pydantic JSON serialization and deserialization. For
  Pydantic models, serialize with `model_dump_json()` and parse JSON bytes or
  strings with `model_validate_json(...)`.
- CI runs `prek` against `.pre-commit-config.yaml`; after code edits, run `prek run --files <changed files>` when practical.
- For CLI or app-discovery changes, smoke test with `uv run biomodals app list`, `uv run biomodals app help <app-name>`, and `uv run biomodals workflow list` when practical.
- Keep generated archives, large run outputs, Modal result directories, and local test data out of commits unless the user explicitly asks for them.
- Avoid extracting trivial helper functions that are only a couple of lines and used once or twice; inline the logic and add comments when that is clearer.

## Instruction maintenance

- Keep root `AGENTS.md` focused on repo-wide expectations. Put long-form context in linked docs under `docs/agents/` or narrower instruction files when that context only applies to a subtree.
- If the app-development skill and reference apps conflict in a way not covered by repo docs, ask for clarification before changing app behavior or updating standards.

## Agent skills

### Modal platform

This repo is built on Modal, a serverless cloud platform for running Python code. See `docs/agents/modal.md`.

## Biomodals app development

When creating, editing, or reviewing files under `src/biomodals/app/**/*_app.py`, use the repo-local `biomodals-app-development` skill. See `docs/agents/app-development.md`.
The detailed app-development standards are consolidated in `.agents/skills/biomodals-app-development/`.

Use these apps as current implementation references:

- `src/biomodals/app/fold/alphafold3_app.py`
- `src/biomodals/app/bioinfo/rosetta_app.py`
- `src/biomodals/app/design/boltzgen_app.py`
- `src/biomodals/app/design/rfdiffusion_app.py` for workflow-compatible
  durable/cached outputs backed by app output volumes.
- `src/biomodals/app/design/ligandmpnn_app.py` for workflow-compatible fast
  rerunnable outputs returned as inline zstd bytes.

When creating future apps, ask whether the app needs to be
workflow-compatible unless the user has already answered. If it does, follow the
workflow-development guidance and use RFdiffusion or LigandMPNN as the closest
reference implementation.

When developing new apps that must violate the skill's conventions for good reason, document the reason for the deviation in `docs/agents/` and link that note from `docs/agents/app-development.md`.

## Biomodals workflow development

When creating or editing reusable workflow runtime code under
`src/biomodals/workflow/` or shared workflow schemas under
`src/biomodals/schema/`, use the repo-local `biomodals-workflow-development`
skill. See `docs/agents/workflow-development.md`.

The detailed workflow-development standards are consolidated in `.agents/skills/biomodals-workflow-development/`.

Use `src/biomodals/workflow/shortmd_workflow.py` as the primary end-to-end workflow reference. Use `src/biomodals/workflow/rfd_ligandmpnn_workflow.py` as the reference for workflows that fan out app-owned volume outputs into another workflow-compatible app function. Ignore `src/biomodals/workflow/ppiflow_workflow.py` as a reference pattern for now because it is expected to be refactored.
