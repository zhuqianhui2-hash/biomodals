    """Convert a PDB or mmCIF file to a list of sequences.

    Each tuple contains a chain ID and its corresponding sequence.
    Note that only the first model in the structure is considered.

    WARNING: non-standard residue names and non-polymer molecules are represented
    as "X" by default, unless they are passed as additional keyword arguments.
    For example, to map "ASH" to "A", you can call this function as
    `struct2seq(path, ASH="A")`. Similarly, you can map water molecules or
    ligands with `struct2seq(path, HOH="o", LIG="l")`.

    Args:
        path: Path to the PDB or mmCIF structure file. The file format is
            automatically detected from the content, and works for both
            text and gzipped files.
        **kwargs: Additional mappings for residue names (3-letter to 1-letter).

    Returns:
        A list of tuple(chain_id, sequence).
