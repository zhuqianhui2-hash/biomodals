# Biomodals App Development

## Core Workflow

Use this skill for Biomodals app files named `*_app.py`.

Before changing behavior, read the current repo guidance:

- `references/app-development.md` for the app-development standards and checklist.
- `docs/agents/app-development.md` for repo-level coordination notes and deviation links.
- The closest reference apps for current patterns:
  - `src/biomodals/app/fold/alphafold3_app.py`
  - `src/biomodals/app/bioinfo/rosetta_app.py`
  - `src/biomodals/app/design/boltzgen_app.py`

For new apps, ask the user which data-flow class applies before choosing architecture: short-lived inference, long-running/cached, or parallel/resumable. If the user already gave enough context, state the classification and proceed.

## Implementation Rules

Keep app code compatible with `biomodals app help` and app discovery:

- Name files `<toolname>_app.py` under `src/biomodals/app/<category>/`.
- Use a user-facing module docstring with upstream links, prerequisites, and output behavior.
- Add `# ruff: noqa: PLC0415` near the top.
- Use module-level `CONF = AppConfig(...)` for new apps; pin `repo_commit_hash` or `version`.
- Let `gpu` and `timeout` be overridden from `os.environ`.
- Build runtime images through `patch_image_for_helper(...)`.
- Before adding app or workflow helpers, check `biomodals.helper` first.
  Reuse existing helper APIs for local output paths, shell, archive, copy,
  download, hashing, warmup, and serialization behavior; only define local
  helpers when the behavior is app-specific and no shared helper fits.
- Prefer `CONF.mounts(...)` for model and output volumes. Import shared volumes
  from `biomodals.helper.constant` only when a function needs a nonstandard
  mountpoint, a shared database/cache volume, or an explicit `commit()`.
  When using `Volume.with_mount_options(...)` directly, combine read-only and
  subpath options in one call.
- Avoid extracting trivial two- or three-line helpers that are used only once or
  twice. Inline them and add a short comment when the intent is not obvious.
- Name local entrypoints `submit_<toolname>_task(...)` and use Google-style `Args:` docstrings so `biomodals app help <app>` renders flags.
- Use `🧬` for local entrypoint status messages and `💊` for remote Modal-container status messages.
- Keep Modal function return values primitive when practical: `int`, `str`,
  `float`, `bool`, `bytes`, `list`, `dict`, or `None`. Return complex objects
  only when they provide much more benefit than a primitive payload, and ensure
  the type is serializable by `cloudpickle`. For example, return paths as
  `str(path)` rather than `Path` objects.
- Add or update an example command under `examples/app/` when app behavior or invocation changes.

## Review Checklist

When reviewing or finishing an app change, check:

- Discovery: path, filename, app name, and local entrypoint name match CLI expectations.
- Reproducibility: upstream version or commit is pinned.
- Runtime boundaries: dependencies used only inside Modal images stay lazily imported.
- Volumes: model/cache mounts use app-specific subdirectories when practical; inference mounts are read-only unless the tool writes caches there; writable volumes are committed after writes; mounted volume paths are logged or returned as `VolumePath` when they cross app/workflow boundaries.
- Data flow: quick jobs return `.tar.zst` bytes via `package_outputs(...)`; persistent, resumable, or batch jobs use `CONF.output_volume`, `CONF.mounts(output_volume=True)`, or shared volumes.
- Modal return payloads: prefer primitive, `cloudpickle`-serializable values;
  avoid returning `Path` objects directly or nested inside tuples, lists, dicts,
  or dataclasses.
- Output safety: local output directories are created, existing tarballs are not overwritten accidentally, and final paths or Modal volume locations are printed.
- CLI docs: local entrypoint docstrings use exact Google-style `Args:` formatting with continuation indentation.
- Verification: run `prek run --files <changed files>` when practical, plus `uv run biomodals app list` and `uv run biomodals app help <app-name>` for CLI or discovery changes.
